# minepi
Mine π decimals for human-readable data using your eyes, space-filling curves &amp; statistical analysis.

## Goal
We split areas of π's decimals abusing *placer mining* analogies at a central community website.
Then people use somewhat developer-agnostic visual reverse engineering software like [..cantor.dust..](https://sites.google.com/site/xxcantorxdustxx/) or an in-browser version not unlike [Cortesi's](http://binvis.io/#/).
They look for easily recognisable patterns that denote common files: bitmaps, text and whatnot.
They *claim* their results on the website at everyone's cheerful amazement.

### Mining π??
To help grasp the concept that π decimals, ie. *numbers*, in fact can be a JPEG on a computer:
* A well written & entertaining blog post [What Colour are your bits?](http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23)
* [The Free Speech flag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy)

### Inspiration
[πfs](https://github.com/philipl/pifs)
They did a more thorough, pedagogical & fun explaination than we did here.
We encourage you to go over there and go through the README.
